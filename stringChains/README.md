/*
You are given a library with n words (w[0], w[1], ..., w[n - 1]). You 
choose a word from it, and in each step, remove one letter from this 
word only if doing so yields a another word in the library. What is the 
longest possible chain of these removal steps? 
Constraints: 
1 ≤ n ≤ 50000 
1 ≤ the length of each string in w ≤ 50 
Each string composed of lowercase ascii letters only. 
Input Format: 
Complete the function "longest_chain" which contains an array of 
strings "w" as its argument. 
Output Format: 
Return a single integer that represents the length of the longest chain of 
character removals possible. 
Sample Input #00: 
6 
a 
b 
ba 
bca 
bda 
bdca 
Sample Output #00:
